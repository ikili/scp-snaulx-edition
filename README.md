# SCP snaulX Edition
**SCP snaulX Edition** is a maze game about SCP ([http://scp-wiki.net/](http://scp-wiki.net/)). In it, you play as a [D-class](http://scp-wiki.net/security-clearance-levels#toc11) employee who was left alone in a complex with nothing with two monsters ([SCP-173](http://scp-wiki.net/scp-173) and [SCP-096](http://scp-wiki.net/scp-096)) (they currently have no abnormal abilities in the game). In order to get out of the complex, the player needs to find cards with which you can open the doors with a high level of access, blow up the complex, find the last card with which you can escape from the complex and escape from it.
